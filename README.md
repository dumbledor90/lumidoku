A simple Sudoku game using Pygame

This game uses an [API](https://sudoku-game-and-api.netlify.app/) to request new boards. Or you can make your custom board and use the **Backtracking** algorithm to solve it.

Features include:
- Hold **CTRL** to select and fill in multiple cells
- Select a number will highlight all the cells with the same value
- ... More to come (maybe)
